=======
Discuss
=======

Odoo *Discuss* is an internal communication app that allows users to connect through messages,
notes, file sharing, and video calls. *Discuss* enables communication through a persistent chat
window that works across applications, or through the dedicated *Discuss* dashboard.

Inbox, Starred, and History
===========================

Unread messages are visible in the :guilabel:`Inbox`. :guilabel:`Starred` is where starred messages
are stored. :guilabel:`History` shows *Chatter* updates for records in the Odoo database that the
user has been assigned to or tagged on.

Direct messages
===============

Direct messages allow the user to communicate privately with one or multiple team members. To start
a new direct message, click the :icon:`fa-plus` icon next to :guilabel:`Direct Messages`.

Direct message actions
----------------------

Hover over a direct message to see a menu of actions to take on the message.

Click :icon:`fa-smile-o` :guilabel:`Add a Reaction` to react to the direct message. Click
:icon:`fa-reply` :guilabel:`Reply` to reply to the direct message in a thread. Click
:icon:`fa-star-o` :guilabel:`Mark as Todo` to add the message to the :guilabel:`Starred` tab.
Clicking :icon:`fa-ellipsis-h` :guilabel:`Expand` reveals more message actions, including
:guilabel:`Pin`, :guilabel:`Mark as Unread`, :guilabel:`Edit`, and :guilabel:`Delete`.

Conversation Actions
--------------------

The icons in the top right corner of a direct message conversation indicate different actions the
user can take on that conversation.

Click :icon:`fa-bell` :guilabel:`Notification Settings` to set up notification preferences
for the conversation, or click :icon:`fa-phone` :guilabel:`Start a Call` to begin a meeting.
See the :ref:`Meetings <discuss/meetings>` section for more information about meetings. Click
:icon:`fa-search` :guilabel:`Search Messages` to search messages in the conversation. Clicking
:icon:`fa-thumb-tack` :guilabel:`Pinned Messages` shows pinned messages, and clicking
:icon:`fa-paperclip` :guilabel:`Show Attachments` shows attachments shared in the
conversation. Click :icon:`fa-user-plus` :guilabel:`Add Users` to invite more people to the
direct message conversation. Click :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Show Call Settings` to configure
voice chat settings.

At the top of the :guilabel:`Direct Message` page, click the name of the direct message to change
the group name.

User status
-----------

It is helpful to see what colleagues are up to and how quickly they can respond to messages by
checking their *status*. The status is shown on the left side of a contact's name on the
:guilabel:`Discuss` sidebar, on the *messaging menu* and when listed in the *Chatter*.

- Green = online
- Orange = away
- White = offline
- Airplane = out of the office

Deleting a direct message conversation
--------------------------------------

To delete direct message conversations from the :guilabel:`Direct Message` view, click the
:guilabel:`X` next to the name of the direct message conversation. This does not delete the
:guilabel:`Direct Messages` in the direct message conversation. The direct message conversation's
history will be visible when another direct message with the same person or group is created.

Channels
========

Configuration
=============

options including :guilabel:`Notification` :guilabel:`Voice & Video`, and
:guilabel:`Canned Responses`.

Select :menuselection:`Configuration --> Notification` to mute a server or adjust the channel's
notification settings.

Select :menuselection:`Configuration --> Voice & Video` to select a voice input device, select
:guilabel:`Voice Detection` or :guilabel:`Push to Talk`, set the voice detection threshold, and
toggle :guilabel:`Show video participants only` and :guilabel:`Blur video background`.

Select :menuselection:`Configuration --> Canned Responses` to configure canned responses. More
information on canned responses can be found in the Canned Responses documentation.

.. _discuss_app/notification_preferences:

Choose notifications preference
===============================

Access user-specific preferences for the *Discuss* app by navigating to :menuselection:`Settings app
--> Manage Users`, select a user, and then click the :menuselection:`Preferences` tab.

.. image:: discuss/preferences-user.png
   :alt: View of the Preferences tab for Odoo Discuss.

By default, the :guilabel:`Notification` field is set as :guilabel:`Handle by Emails`. With this
setting enabled, a notification email will be sent by Odoo every time a message is sent from the
chatter, a note is sent with an `@` mention (from *Chatter*), or a notification is sent for a record
that the user follows. Something that triggers a notification is changing of the stage (if an email
is configured to be sent, for example if the task is set to :guilabel:`Done`).

By choosing :guilabel:`Handle in Odoo`, the above notifications are shown in the *Discuss* app's
:guilabel:`Inbox`.

Chat from different applications
================================

The *Discuss* application enables communication across all of Odoo's applications. To view chats and
channels, or start a new message, select the speech bubbles in the upper right corner of another app
in Odoo.
