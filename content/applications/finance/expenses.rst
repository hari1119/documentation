Expenses
========

Odoo **Expenses** streamlines the management of expenses. After an employee submits their expenses
in Odoo, they are reviewed by management and accounting teams. Once approved, payments can then be
processed, and disbursed back to the employee for reimbursement.

.. seealso::
   `Odoo Expenses: product page <https://www.odoo.com/app/expenses>`_

Set expense categories
======================

The first step to track expenses is to configure the different types of expenses for the company
(managed as *expense categories* in Odoo). Each category can be as specific or generalized as
needed. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Configuration --> Expense Categories` to view the
current expensable categories in a default list view.

.. image:: expenses/categories.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Set expense costs on products.

To create a new expense category, click :guilabel:`New`. A product form will appear, with the
description field labeled :guilabel:`Product Name`.

.. note::
   Expense categories are managed like products in Odoo. The expense category form follows the
   standard product form in Odoo, and the information entered is similar. Expense products will be
   referred to as expense categories throughout this document since the main menu refers to these as
   :guilabel:`Expense Categories`.

Only two fields are required, the :guilabel:`Product Name` and the :guilabel:`Unit of Measure`.
Enter the :guilabel:`Product Name` in the field, and select the :guilabel:`Unit of Measure` from the
drop-down menu (most products will be set to :guilabel:`Units`).

.. tip::
   The *Sales* app is where specification on the units of measure are created and edited (e.g.
   units, miles, nights, etc.). Go to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings` and
   ensure `Units of Measure` is enabled in the `Product Catalog` section. Click on the
   :guilabel:`Units of Measure` internal link to :doc:`view, create, and edit the units of measure
   <../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/product_management/product_replenishment/uom>`.

.. image:: expenses/new-expense-product.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Set expense costs on products.

The :guilabel:`Cost` field on the product form is populated with a value of `0.00` by default. When
a specific expense should always be reimbursed for a particular price, enter that amount in the
:guilabel:`Cost` field. Otherwise, leave the :guilabel:`Cost` set to `0.00`, and employees will
report the actual cost when submitting an expense report.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Cost` field is always visible on the expense category form, but the
   :guilabel:`Sales Price` field is *only* visible if the :guilabel:`Sales Price` is selected under
   the :guilabel:`Re-Invoice Expenses` section. Otherwise, the :guilabel:`Sales Price` field is
   hidden.

.. example::
   Here are some examples for when to set a specific :guilabel:`Cost` on a product vs. leaving the
   :guilabel:`Cost` at `0.00`:

   - **Meals**: set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.00`. When an employee logs an expense for a meal,
     they enter the actual amount of the bill and will be reimbursed for that amount. An expense for
     a meal costing $95.23 would equal a reimbursement for $95.23.
   - **Mileage**: set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.30`. When an employee logs an expense for
     "mileage", they enter the number of miles driven in the :guilabel:`Quantity` field, and are
     reimbursed 0.30 per mile they entered. An expense for 100 miles would equal a reimbursement for
     $30.00.
   - **Monthly Parking**: set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `75.00`. When an employee logs an expense for
     "monthly parking", the reimbursement would be for $75.00.
   - **Expenses**: set the :guilabel:`Cost` to `0.00`. When an employee logs an expense that is not
     a meal, mileage, or monthly parking, they use the generic :guilabel:`Expenses` product. An
     expense for a laptop costing $350.00 would be logged as an :guilabel:`Expenses` product, and
     the reimbursement would be for $350.00.

Select an :guilabel:`Expense Account` if using the Odoo *Accounting* app. It is recommended to check
with the accounting department to determine the correct account to reference in this field as it
will affect reports.

Set a tax on each product in the :guilabel:`Vendor Taxes` and :guilabel:`Customer Taxes` fields, if
applicable. It is considered good practice to use a tax that is configured with :ref:`Tax Included
in Price <taxes/included-in-price>`. Taxes will be automatically configured if this is set.

Record expenses
===============

Manually create a new expense
-----------------------------

To record a new expense, begin in the main :menuselection:`Expenses` app dashboard, which presents
the default :guilabel:`My Expenses` view. This view can also be accessed from
:menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses`.

First, click :guilabel:`New`, and then fill out the various fields on the form.

- :guilabel:`Description`: enter a short description for the expense in the :guilabel:`Description`
  field. This should be short and informative, such as `lunch with client` or `hotel for
  conference`.
- :guilabel:`Category`: select the expense category from the drop-down menu that most closely
  corresponds to the expense. For example, an airplane ticket would be appropriate for an expense
  :guilabel:`Category` named :guilabel:`Air Travel`.
- :guilabel:`Total`: Enter the total amount paid for the expense in one of two ways:

  #. If the expense is for one single item/expense, and the category selected was for a single item,
     enter the cost in the :guilabel:`Total` field (the :guilabel:`Quantity` field is hidden).
  #. If the expense is for multiples of the same item/expense with a fixed price, the
     :guilabel:`Unit Price` is displayed. Enter the quantity in the :guilabel:`Quantity` field, and
     the total cost is automatically updated with the correct total (the :guilabel:`Unit Price` x
     the :guilabel:`Quantity` = the total). Be advised, the word "total" does not appear, the total
     cost simply appears below the :guilabel:`Quantity`.

     .. example::
        For example, in the case of mileage driven, the :guilabel:`Unit Price` is populated as the
        cost *per mile*. Set the :guilabel:`Quantity` to the *number of miles* driven, and the total
        is calculated.

- :guilabel:`Included Taxes`: if taxes were configured on the expense category, the tax percentage
  and amount appear automatically after entering either the :guilabel:`Total` or the
  :guilabel:`Quantity`.

  .. note::
     When a tax is configured on an expense category, the :guilabel:`Included Taxes` value will
     update in real time as the :guilabel:`Total` or :guilabel:`Quantity` is updated.

- :guilabel:`Employee`: using the drop-down menu, select the employee this expense is for.
- :guilabel:`Paid By`: click the radio button to indicate who paid for the expense and should be
  reimbursed. If the employee paid for the expense (and should be reimbursed) select
  :guilabel:`Employee (to reimburse)`. If the company paid directly instead (e.g. if the company
  credit card was used to pay for the expense) select :guilabel:`Company`. Depending on the expense
  category selected, this field may not appear.
- :guilabel:`Bill Reference`: if there is any reference text that should be included for the
  expense, enter it in this field.
- :guilabel:`Expense Date`: using the calendar module, enter the date the expense was incurred. Use
  the :guilabel:`< (left)` and :guilabel:`> (right)` arrows to navigate to the correct month, then
  click on the specific day to enter the selection.
- :guilabel:`Account`: select the expense account that this expense should be logged on from the
  drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice`: if the expense is something that should be paid for by a
  customer, select the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` and customer that will be invoiced for this expense
  from the drop-down menu. All sales orders in the drop-down menu list both the :abbr:`SO (Sales
  Order)` as well as the company the sales order is written for, but after the expense is saved, the
  customer name disappears and only the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` is visible on the expense.

  .. example::
     A customer wishes to have an on-site meeting for a custom garden (design and installation) and
     agrees to pay for the expenses associated with it (such as travel, hotel, meals, etc.). All
     expenses tied to that meeting would indicate the sales order for the custom garden (which also
     references the customer) as the :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice`.

- :guilabel:`Analytic Distribution`: select the accounts the expense should be written against from
  the drop-down menu for either :guilabel:`Projects`, :guilabel:`Departments`, or both. Multiple
  accounts can be listed for each category, if needed. Adjust the percentage for each analytic
  account by typing in the percentage value next to the account.
- :guilabel:`Company`: if multiple companies are set up, select the company this expense should be
  filed for from the drop-down menu. The current company automatically populates this field.
- :guilabel:`Notes...`: if any notes are needed to clarify the expense, enter them in this field.

   :alt: A filled in expense form for a client lunch.

Attach a receipt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the expense is created, the next step is to attach a receipt. Click the :guilabel:`Attach
Receipt` button, and a file explorer appears. Navigate to the receipt to be attached, and click
:guilabel:`Open`. The new receipt is recorded in the chatter, and the number of receipts will appear
next to the :guilabel:`ðŸ“Ž (paperclip)` icon beneath the expense form. More than one receipt can be
attached to an individual expense, as needed. The number of receipts attached to the expense will be
noted on the paperclip icon.

.. image:: expenses/receipt-icon.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Attach a receipt and it appears in the chatter.

Create new expenses from a scanned receipt
------------------------------------------

Rather than manually inputting all of the information for an expense, expenses can be created by
scanning a PDF receipt.

First, in the main :guilabel:`Expenses` app dashboard view (this view can also be accessed from
:menuselection:`Expenses app --> My Expenses --> My Expenses`), click :guilabel:`Scan`, and a file
explorer pops up. Navigate to the receipt to be uploaded, click on it to select it, and then click
:guilabel:`Open`.

.. image:: expenses/scan.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Create an expense by scanning a receipt. Click Scan at the top of the Expenses dashboard
         view.

The receipt is scanned, and a new entry is created with today's date as the :guilabel:`Expense
Date`, and any other fields it can populate based on the scanned data, such as the total. Click on
the new entry to open the individual expense form, and make any changes needed. The scanned receipt
appears in the chatter.

Automatically create new expenses from an email
-----------------------------------------------

Instead of individually creating each expense in the *Expenses* app, expenses can be automatically
created by sending an email to an email alias.

To do so, first, an email alias needs to be configured. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Settings`. Ensure :guilabel:`Incoming Emails` is enabled.

.. image:: expenses/email-alias.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Create the domain alias by clicking the link.

.. note::
   If the domain alias needs to be set up, :guilabel:`Setup your domain alias` will appear beneath
   the incoming emails check box instead of the email address field. Refer to this documentation for
   setup instructions and more information:
   :doc:`/applications/websites/website/configuration/domain_names`. Once the domain alias is
   configured, the email address field will be visible beneath the incoming emails section.

Next, enter the email address to be used in the email field, and then click :guilabel:`Save`. Now
that the email address has been entered, emails can be sent to that alias to create new expenses
without having to be in the Odoo database.

To submit an expense via email, create a new email and enter the product's *internal reference* code
(if available) and the amount of the expense in the email subject. Next, attach the receipt to the
email. Odoo creates the expense by taking the information in the email subject and combining it with
the receipt.

To check an expense categories internal reference, go to :menuselection:`Expenses app -->
Configuration --> Expense Categories`. If an internal reference is listed on the expense category,
it is listed in the :guilabel:`Internal Reference` column.

.. image:: expenses/ref.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Categories view.

To add an internal reference on an expense category, click on the category to open the form. Enter
the internal reference in the field. Beneath the :guilabel:`Internal Reference` field, this sentence
appears: :guilabel:`Use this reference as a subject prefix when submitting by email.`

.. image:: expenses/mileage-internal-reference.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Internal reference numbers are listed in the main Expense Products view.

.. note::
   For security purposes, only authenticated employee emails are accepted by Odoo when creating an
   expense from an email. To confirm an authenticated employee email address, go to the employee
   card in the :menuselection:`Employees` app, and refer to the :guilabel:`Work Email`

   .. image:: expenses/authenticated-email-address.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Create the domain alias by clicking the link.

.. example::
   If submitting an expense via email for a $25.00 meal during a work trip, the email subject would
   be `FOOD $25.00`.

   Explanation:

   - The :guilabel:`Internal Reference` for the expense category `Meals` is `FOOD`
   - The :guilabel:`Cost` for the expense is `$25.00`

Reimburse employees
===================

After an expense report is posted to an accounting journal, the next step is to reimburse the
employee. To view all the expense reports to pay, go to :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Expense
Reports --> Reports To Pay`.

.. image:: expenses/reports-to-pay.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View reports to pay by clicking on expense reports, then reports to pay.

Just like approvals and posting, expense reports can be paid in two ways (individually or several at
once). To pay multiple expense reports at once, remain in the list view. First, select the reports
to pay by ticking the checkbox next to each report, or tick the checkbox next to
:guilabel:`Employee` to select all the reports in the list. Next, click :guilabel:`Register
Payment`.

.. image:: expenses/register-payment.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Post multiple reports by selecting them, clicking the gear, and then post the entries.

To pay an individual report, click on a report to go to a detailed view of that report. Click
:guilabel:`Register Payment` to pay the employee.

A :guilabel:`Register Payment` pop-up appears, and the :guilabel:`Journal`, :guilabel:`Payment
Method`, and :guilabel:`Payment Date` can be modified, if needed. When the selections are correct,
click :guilabel:`Create Payment` to send the payment to the employee.

To pay an individual report, click on a report in the list view to go to a detailed view of that
report. Click :guilabel:`Register Payment` to pay the employee. A :guilabel:`Register Payment`
pop-up appears, but when paying an individual expense report instead of several at once, more
options appear in the pop-up. In addition to the :guilabel:`Journal`, :guilabel:`Payment Method`,
and :guilabel:`Payment Date` fields, a :guilabel:`Recipient Bank Account`, :guilabel:`Amount`, and
:guilabel:`Memo` field appear. Select the employee's bank account from the drop-down menu to
directly deposit the payment to their account. When all other selections are correct, click
:guilabel:`Create Payment` to send the payment to the employee.

.. image:: expenses/two-payment-posting-options.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Different options appear when registering an individual expense report versus multiple
         expense reports at once.

Re-invoice expenses to customers
================================

If expenses are tracked on customer projects, expenses can be automatically charged back to the
customer. This is done by creating an expense, referencing the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` the expense
should be added to, and then creating the expense report. Next, managers approve the expense report,
and the accounting department posts the journal entries. Finally, once the expense report is posted
to a journal, the expenses appear on the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` that was referenced. The sales
order can then be invoiced, thus invoicing the customer for the expense.

Setup
-----

First, specify the invoicing policy for each expense category. Go to :menuselection:`Expenses app
--> Configuration --> Expense Categories`. Click on the expense category to open the expense
category form. Under the :guilabel:`Invoicing` section, click the radio button next to the desired
selection for :guilabel:`Re-Invoicing Expenses`. Options are :guilabel:`None`, :guilabel:`At cost`,
and :guilabel:`Sales price`.

:guilabel:`Re-Invoicing Expenses`:

- :guilabel:`None`: Expense category will not be re-invoiced.
- :guilabel:`At cost`: Expense category will invoice expenses at their real cost.
- :guilabel:`At sales price`: Expense category will invoice the price set on the sale order.

Create an expense
-----------------

First, when :doc:`creating a new expense <expenses/log_expenses>`, the correct information needs to
be entered in order to re-invoice a customer. Select the *sales order* the expense will appear on in
the :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` section, from the drop-down menu. Next, select the
:guilabel:`Analytic Account` the expense will be posted to. After the expense(s) are created, the
expense report needs to be :doc:`created <expenses/expense_reports>` and :ref:`submitted
<expenses/submit>` as usual.

.. image:: expenses/reinvoice-expense.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Ensure the customer to be invoiced is called out on the expense.

.. important::
   Selecting a :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` when creating an expense is critical, since this is
   what causes the expenses to be automatically invoiced after an expense report is approved.

   The :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` field can be modified *until an expense report is*
   **approved**, then the field is no longer able to be modified.

Validate and post expenses
--------------------------

Only employees with permissions (typically, managers or supervisors) can :doc:`approve expenses
<expenses/approve_expenses>`. Before approving an expense report, ensure the :guilabel:`Analytic
Distribution` is set on every expense line of a report. If an :guilabel:`Analytic Distribution` is
missing, assign the correct accounts from the drop-down menu, and click :guilabel:`Approve` or
:guilabel:`Refuse`.

The accounting department is typically responsible for :doc:`posting journal entries
<expenses/post_expenses>`. Once an expense report is approved, it can then be posted. The :abbr:`SO
(Sales Order)` is **only** updated *after* the journal entries are posted. Once the journal entries
are posted, the expenses now appear on the referenced :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`.

Invoice expenses
----------------

Once the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` has been updated, it is time to invoice the customer. After the
expense report has been approved and the journal entries have been posted, click the
:guilabel:`Sales Orders` smart button to open the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`. The expenses to be
re-invoiced are now on the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`.

.. image:: expenses/sales-order.png
   :align: center
   :alt: After the expense report is posted to the journal entry, the sales order can be called up
         by clicking on the sales order number.

.. note::
   More than one :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` can be referenced on an expense report. If more than one
   :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` is referenced, the :guilabel:`Sales Orders` smart button will list the
   number of :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`'s. If multiple :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`'s are listed, the
   :guilabel:`Sales Orders` smart button opens a list view of all the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`'s on
   the expense report. Click on a :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` to open the individual :abbr:`SO (Sales
   Order)`.

The expenses are listed in the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab.
